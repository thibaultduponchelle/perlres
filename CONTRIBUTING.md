I’m really glad that you are interested in contributing to **perlres** !

First of all, respect great predecessors and all contributors in Perl community.

This guide is inspired by awesome-perl [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/hachiojipm/awesome-perl/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

# Contribution Guidelines

* **To add to the list** : Submit a pull request
* **To remove from the list** : Open an issue (you must describe a reason !)

## Formatting
### Example of Item of List

```
- :dancer: [Dancer](http://perldancer.org/) - Minimalist Web framework created by [Alexis Sukrieh](https://metacpan.org/author/SUKRIA)
```

Will produce : 
- :dancer: [Dancer](http://perldancer.org/) - Minimalist Web framework created by [Alexis Sukrieh](https://metacpan.org/author/SUKRIA)


### Emojis
Take github emojis from this [list](https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908)

#### Emojis in titles
- Categories (means `## :rocket: Second level title`) should have an emoji
- Sub Categories (means `### Third level title`) should NOT have an emoji 

#### Emojis in list items
##### Emojis related to item
Often emojis are related to the item : see for instance all **CMS** software where I use :memo: :pencil2: :clipboard: and friends...

Another example of an emoji related to the software itself : **ACT** has a :seat: because it's related to conferences and people sitting in a room to listen talks.

We could have used the same emoji for all CMS, but having different one and putting them randomly looks *prettier* :innocent:

##### Emojis not related to item
Sometimes emojis does not always have a meaning at all and only respect a kind of "family". 

Typical example is webframeworks that are generaly represented by animals :cow: :bear: :frog: :hamster: simply because I needed a lot of different emojis and they are so cool :relieved:

:warning: Some emojis are not compatible with mobiles, please do not use them.

## Tips

For the links, choose first the official website (if any) then the [github repository](https://github.com/) then the [metaCPAN](https://metacpan.org/)

If you put official website first, you can provide a [github link](https://github.com/) (or a [metaCPAN link](https://metacpan.org/)) at the end of the line.

Remember that this is not stricly a module list like [Task::Kensho](https://github.com/EnlightenedPerlOrganisation/task-kensho) otherwise I would have chosen in priority the [metaCPAN link](https://metacpan.org/)

## Quality Standard

This list is for *people with a minimum Perl background* 

It can be used by people that do not know Perl at all (or very few) but you don't have to make this list fully accessible for these folks.

Old softwares could appear, even if not maintained for years, but only if they seems not completely dead.

Stay concise.
